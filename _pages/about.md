I finished my master degree in [Mathematics in Data Science](https://www.tum.de/en/studies/degree-programs/detail/mathematics-in-data-science-master-of-science-msc) from Technical University of Munich in April 2024. I spent a year working and assisting PhD student and PostDoc at Helmholtz Munich - [Theis Lab](https://www.helmholtz-munich.de/en/icb/research-groups/theis-lab) majorly working on data science projects that model perturbation caused by machine learning model for single cell datasets. We build models that based on statistical research for modeling perturbation and run experiments to test robustness of different statistical distance functions with results in [this project](https://github.com/theislab/perturbation-metrics). I also completed my thesis on modifing multi-modal VAE model for processing sequential data([here](https://github.com/ml5376/thesis)).


In 2020, I recieved my undergraduate degree from Mathematics department of Courant Institute at [New York University](https://math.nyu.edu/dynamic/). 


My research interests include machine learning, machine learning with sequential data and bioinformatics.You can find my CV [here](../assets/CV.pdf).
